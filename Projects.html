Case Study: Marvel Fandom
My major examines digital and interactive media with a focus on online communities, participatory culture, and social communication. Through a case study of the Marvel fandom, I analyzed how fandoms function as digital communities by using social capital, grassroots creativity, crowdsourcing, and interactive media platforms to engage millions of users. I also explored the limitations of these systems, including the rise of toxicity and online bullying in large-scale communities, demonstrating a critical understanding of both the benefits and challenges of digital media ecosystems. </h3>

Through research on conformity, credibility, and social influence, I examined concepts such as normative and informational influence, social proof, social loafing, and group dynamics, as well as key dimensions of credibility including expertise, goodwill, trustworthiness, and composure. This work highlights my academic focus on analyzing human behavior, persuasion, and interaction within social systems. </p>

The study examines self-reported mental health before and after joining Greek organizations, as well as perceptions of peer pressure and mental health stigma within these communities.
  <h2><a href="https://emgoritha12.github.io/EscapeRoom/index.html">Escape Room Website</a> </h2> <h3><p> In a foundational freshman course, I designed and built an interactive escape room website inspired by Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Using HTML and CSS, I created a series of puzzles and challenges that users had to solve to reach the crystal skull and “win” a virtual prize. This project allowed me to combine storytelling, user experience design, and coding, bringing course concepts to life in an engaging and playful digital environment. </p>
 <h2><a href="https://emgoritha12.github.io/WebDesignFinal/index.html">Repository Website</a> </h2> <h3><p> In my freshman web design course, I created a multi-page website entirely with HTML and CSS, compiling several individual projects into a single cohesive online portfolio. This project challenged me to think critically about file structure, navigation, and linking, while showcasing my ability to combine design principles with technical execution. It was an early exploration of how digital culture and design concepts can be translated into interactive, functional web experiences.
   <h2><a href="https://emgoritha12.github.io/ArtPortfolioRepository/index.html">Critical Piece: Art Website</a> </h2> <h3><p>During my junior year in Digital Culture and Design, I conceptualized, designed, and developed a 15-page website entirely from scratch using HTML and CSS. The project emphasized digital repository design, structured file organization, internal linking, and modular page architecture to create a cohesive, scalable web experience. I implemented clean code practices, connected assets through structured file systems, and managed version control and deployment through GitHub. This project reflects my academic focus on the intersection of design, technology, and human-centered digital systems, demonstrating how technical implementation supports usability, organization, and digital storytelling. </p>
