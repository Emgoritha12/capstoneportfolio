Case Study: Marvel Fandom
My major examines digital and interactive media with a focus on online communities, participatory culture, and social communication. Through a case study of the Marvel fandom, I analyzed how fandoms function as digital communities by using social capital, grassroots creativity, crowdsourcing, and interactive media platforms to engage millions of users. I also explored the limitations of these systems, including the rise of toxicity and online bullying in large-scale communities, demonstrating a critical understanding of both the benefits and challenges of digital media ecosystems. </h3>

Through research on conformity, credibility, and social influence, I examined concepts such as normative and informational influence, social proof, social loafing, and group dynamics, as well as key dimensions of credibility including expertise, goodwill, trustworthiness, and composure. This work highlights my academic focus on analyzing human behavior, persuasion, and interaction within social systems. </p>

The study examines self-reported mental health before and after joining Greek organizations, as well as perceptions of peer pressure and mental health stigma within these communities.
  <h2><a href="https://emgoritha12.github.io/EscapeRoom/index.html">Escape Room Website</a> </h2> <h3><p> For one of my foundational classes, freshman year, I was given the opportunity to build a interactive escape room website. The theme was based on the movie Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The goal is to get past the puzzles so that you can race to get the crystal skull, and at the end you "win" a prize. </p>
 <h2><a href="https://emgoritha12.github.io/WebDesignFinal/index.html">Repository Website</a> </h2> <h3><p> During my Freshman year, in my web design class, I was given the opportunity to build a multi-page website from html and css. The goal was to put together a repository of my coursework. 
   <h2><a href="https://emgoritha12.github.io/ArtPortfolioRepository/index.html">Critical Piece: Art Website</a> </h2> <h3><p> For my DCD Class of my junior year in college, I was given the opportunity to be creative with my final project. I was told that as long as it relates to something in the course, then it can be made. So I chose the time we talked about a repository and ended up building a 15 page website made from scratch code. </p>
