Case Study: Marvel Fandom
For one of my journalism classes, I was informed to do a case study on a group of people. I decided to do a case study on the marvel fandom and how they function as a community online and in person. </h3>

I decided to do conformity as a form of persuasion. I was also later instructed to do a revision to this assignment, so I made sure to add the dimensions of credibility in addition to conformity to show what makes a source credible </p>

  <h2><a href="https://emgoritha12.github.io/EscapeRoom/index.html">Escape Room Website</a> </h2> <h3><p> For one of my foundational classes, freshman year, I was given the opportunity to build a interactive escape room website. The theme was based on the movie Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The goal is to get past the puzzles so that you can race to get the crystal skull, and at the end you "win" a prize. </p>
 <h2><a href="https://emgoritha12.github.io/WebDesignFinal/index.html">Repository Website</a> </h2> <h3><p> For my web design class, I was given the opportunity to build a multi-page website from html and css. The goal was to put together a repository of my coursework. 
   <h2><a href="https://emgoritha12.github.io/ArtPortfolioRepository/index.html">Art Website</a> </h2> <h3><p> For my DCD Class last semester, I was given the opportunity to be creative with my final project. I was told that as long as it relates to something in the course, then it can be made. So I chose the time we talked about a repository and ended up building a 15 page website made from scratch code. </p>
