    <center><h2> Hello </h2> </center> <h3> <p>  My name is Emma Williamson and I am a Digital Culture and Design Major at Coastal Carolina University. My focus is in web design.
<p>I created this website to showcase the works I have made throughout the years in a digital repository made completely from scratch. I enjoy building websites and writing.  My goal as a DCD major is to learn more about web design and its applications so that I may use it in a career in the future.
</p>
<p>My diverse skillset allows me to work effectively in many unique digital environments ranging from creating websites from raw coding and wix software, to developing and implementing social media strategies. Today, I possess thorough knowledge of the field of Digital Design with the ability to perform the creation of websites.
